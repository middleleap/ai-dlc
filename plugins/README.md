# Plugins

Reusable plugins that extend AI agent capabilities — authentication helpers, API connectors, data transformers, and more.

## Adding a Plugin

1. Create a folder: `plugins/<category>/<plugin-name>/`
2. Include a `PLUGIN.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
3. Register in `marketplace.json` at the repo root
4. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for naming conventions and size guidelines
