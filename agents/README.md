# Agents

Pre-built agent configurations and workflows — autonomous task runners, multi-step pipelines, and domain-specific assistants.

## Adding an Agent

1. Create a folder: `agents/<category>/<agent-name>/`
2. Include an `AGENT.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
3. Register in `marketplace.json` at the repo root
4. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for naming conventions and size guidelines
